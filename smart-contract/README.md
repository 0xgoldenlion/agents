#### **📌 Overview**
The **DroneLanding** smart contract is a **demonstration prototype** designed to simulate **autonomous drone landing approvals** using blockchain technology. It enables drones to **request landing permission**, and an **off-chain script** automatically **approves the request** by calling the smart contract.

---

### **🚀 Features**
✅ **Decentralized Landing Approval** – Drones send landing requests on-chain.  
✅ **Automated Off-Chain Approval** – A script listens for requests and approves them.  
✅ **Landing Zone Assignment** – Each drone is assigned a landing area.  
✅ **Permissioned Landing** – Unauthorized drones cannot request landing.  

---

### **⚠️ Current Limitations**
❌ **No Real Drone Authentication** – Any address can call `requestLanding()`.  
❌ **Fixed Landing Zones** – The landing zone is hardcoded (`"Zone A"`).  
❌ **No Payment or Priority System** – No fees or prioritization for landing requests.  
❌ **Off-Chain Dependency** – Approvals happen via an external script, requiring continuous monitoring.

### **💡 Future Enhancements for Realistic Use**
🔹 **Proof of Identity for Drones** – Using **cryptographic signatures** to verify authorized drones.  
🔹 **Dynamic Landing Zones** – Assign zones based on **real-time airspace data**.  
🔹 **Smart Pricing for Landing** – Implement **dynamic pricing based on demand**.  
🔹 **Integration with IoT Sensors** – Use **real drone telemetry** to validate safe landing.  
🔹 **On-Chain Approvals** – Remove off-chain dependencies by handling approvals with **smart contract logic and oracles**.

### **📜 Disclaimer**
⚠️ This contract is **for demonstration purposes only** and **should not be used in real-world deployments** without additional security measures. The current implementation lacks **drone authentication, safety constraints, and collision avoidance mechanisms** required for real-world autonomous drone operations.
